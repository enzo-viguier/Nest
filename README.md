# Welcome to Nest - Your Next Stay, Simplified!

**Nest** is an innovative web application designed to revolutionize the way people find and book accommodations. Inspired by the familiar functionalities of platforms like AirBnB, Nest is built using the powerful MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js), offering a seamless experience for both property owners and guests seeking the perfect stay.

## About the Project

This project is part of the HAI806I course requirements for the 2023-2024 academic year, where we were tasked with creating a web application for lodging rentals. The core of Nest lies in its robust database and intuitive user interface, allowing users to easily search, view, and book accommodations tailored to their needs.

### Key Features

- **Multi-criteria Search**: Users can filter their accommodation search based on start and end dates, location, price, minimum number of bedrooms, minimum number of beds, and maximum distance from the city center.
- **Accommodation Listings**: Browse available properties complete with detailed descriptions, average ratings from past guests, and the ability to book your stay.
- **Ratings and Reviews**: After staying, guests can leave a rating and review for future guests to reference.
- **User Authentication** *(Bonus Feature)*: Enhanced security and personalized experiences through user login functionality.
- **Geolocation** *(Bonus Feature)*: View properties on a map to find the perfect location for your stay.
- **Commentable Reviews** *(Bonus Feature)*: Engage with the community by commenting on reviews.

### Database Design

Our MongoDB database houses three main collections:
- **Users**: Including email, first name, last name, and phone number.
- **Properties**: Detailed information about the rental properties.
- **Rentals**: Records of bookings, including dates and guest reviews.

## Getting Started

To run Nest on your local machine, ensure you have MongoDB, Node.js, and Angular CLI installed. Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in our documentation to start exploring accommodations or listing your own property.
